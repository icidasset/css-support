This is the Elm module generator which takes data from the [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com) Github repo and then reduces it into an Elm module.


### Todo

In Haskell:

- Download the JSON file from the caniuse github repo
- Filter down the data (only keep CSS related stuff)
- Transform the data into something more usable
- Create Elm module
